# Science-Bot
This was my first project integrating GUIs NLPs. I used TKinter for the user interface and the nltk library for the Primitive NLP. I'll be adding more features and datasets to increase the bot's functionality. In order to run this project, it's essential for the user to install the NLTK library and run, the initiate.py file.
